## 💡 Overview

**SUST Connect** is a focused platform built to enhance institutional communication and engagement within the SUST community.  
It aims to provide **a distraction-free, verified, and academically relevant environment** for students, faculty, and administrative staff.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Centralize university-wide notices, news, and event updates.  
- Reduce dependency on general-purpose social media platforms.  
- Ensure authenticity and administrative control through verified content.  
- Encourage inter-departmental awareness and participation.

## 🔥 Motivation

> “Ever wondered what’s going on in the Chemistry department? Or what the latest research or competitions are across campus?”

SUST is home to **8500+ students** and **550+ teachers** — a diverse, vibrant academic community. Yet, information about departmental research, seminars, or events is often scattered across multiple channels.

Existing social media platforms are **distracting** and **not optimized** for institutional communication.  
**SUST Connect** is our solution — a dedicated, university-administered space for **authentic academic and organizational updates**.

Our vision is to build a web-based platform first, followed by **Android and iOS** mobile apps for greater accessibility.
